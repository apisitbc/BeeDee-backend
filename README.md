# Overview



You will need to run NPM or Yarn to install dependencies and compile the TypeScript code. For example:

```
npm run compile
```

or

```
yarn compile
```

The application can be started in development mode by running:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

Once running, the application should restart when changes to the **JavaScript** are detected.
